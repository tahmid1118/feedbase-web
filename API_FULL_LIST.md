# Feedbase Full API List

## Base URL

`http://localhost:4560`

## Headers

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` for protected routes
- `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON endpoints
- `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` for file upload

## Notes

- `lg` is required on routes using `languageValidator`.
- Several GET/DELETE/PATCH routes still read `lg` from request body.
- Success response shape is usually `{ status, message, data? }`.
- Login returns `user` instead of `data`.
- Image upload returns `filePath`.
